# Fantasy Team Draft

A simple Flask web application that lets users take turns drafting starter and bench players for two fantasy teams, Team A and Team B. Each player is randomly generated by decade, position, and ability (for starters), and players can be rerolled or accepted with a custom name input.

## Features

- Generate random players for both starters and bench.
- Alternate drafting between Team A and Team B.
- Reroll players if you don't like the draw.
- View completed rosters for starters and bench once drafting is complete.
- Responsive, styled interface using Jinja2 templates.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fantasy-team-draft.git
